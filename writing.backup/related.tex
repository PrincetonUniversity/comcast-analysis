\paragraph{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item No difference between test and control set:
\item Usage Patterns:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Overall data rate and average utilization are similar
	\item Absolute aggregated peak data rate doesnâ€™t rise
	\item Prime time seems to be 8p-12a for both sets
	\end{itemize}
\item This suggests that (1) the series are similar and (2) ISP is not the bottleneck for heavy users
\item Changes, maybe due to access link:
\item Peak utilization per device
\item For time slots with low data transferred over 15m, peak usage per device is higher in the test set
\item Prime Time (or Peak) Ratios
\item 90\% of users in the test set have higher peak ratio, i.e., 90-\%ile peak usage:median usage per day
\item median peak ratio is 2 times more for the test set
\item This suggests a possibility that short bursts (<15 min) have a higher data rate on avg, but not long bursts.
