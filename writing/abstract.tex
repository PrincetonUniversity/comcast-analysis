\begin{abstract}

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently declared that ``advanced
telecommunication capabilities'' are not being deployed in the US in a timely fashion~\citep{fcc2015progress-report}. In an attempt to encourage Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to invest in deploying advanced broadband, the Commission
has requested comments on issues pertaining to availability, deployment,
and adoption of broadband.

In this work, we provide a much required input to the FCC's open questions,
supported by our analysis of usage patterns. We present case study
examining the relationship between supply (availability) and demand
(adoption) in a controlled experiment. Our analysis shows that peak user demand
within a single high speed tier is highly diverse, even when accounting for
factors such as capacity, cost, performance, and location. This work motivates
the need to adopt user demand as a benchmark to further the deployment
of ``advanced'' broadband capabilities in the US.
