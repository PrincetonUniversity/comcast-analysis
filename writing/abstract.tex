\begin{abstract}
We present an analysis of usage patterns of high tier Comcast subscribers. This study focuses on changes in usage behavior of two groups of users in the same city, a control group (105 Mbps tier link) and a treatment group (250 Mbps tier link). The treatment group were randomly selected from the control group to receive 250 Mbps without their knowledge.

The law of diminishing returns between capacity and usage demand is well documented for users with low  tiers (tight links) and high service demands (high link utilization). This work presents the first study focusing on higher tiers. Our results show that high-tier subscribers with a high demand (greedy-rich) do not increase their demands with the treatment. However, subscribers with a lower demand (frugal-rich) show a significant increase in their daily demands. Furthermore, most of this increase was observed during the off-peak hours.
