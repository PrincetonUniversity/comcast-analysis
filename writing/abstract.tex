\begin{abstract}

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has recently taken major decisions in an attempt to 
regulate broadband usage and deployment in the US, creating disputes between itself and ISP providers.
One such policy is the radical increase of the broadband speed threshold that motivated both parties
to study the effect of these regulations from different perspectives. This has led to the Commission
publically requesting comments on issues pertaining to defining ``advanced telecommunication capabilities''
to design benchmarks based on metrics other than broadband speed.

In this work, we provide a much required input to the FCC's open questions,
supported analysis of usage patterns rather than just the FCC’s speed benchmarks.
We analyse users with high tier access links and motivate
the need of multiple speed benchmarks based on peak usage of different types
of users. We also show that beyond a certain speed, user behavior is not
significantly impacted by further increases in broadband capacity, thus
motivating the need to define benchmarks based on metrics other than broadband
speed to truly offer ``advanced'' capabilities.
