\todo{just some stats on asymmetry: maybe merge this with usage??}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item \todo{maybe this doesn't need a separate section, just comment on asymmetry in each of the above}
\item Cisco vs Alcatel: upload is increasing vs there's still too much download
\item Claim that its reducing due to uploads, but content is mostly download. Is the ratio still 10:1 (FCC thinks its ~25:3)
\item Compare with Sandvine asymmetry stats
\item Talk about 3 Mbps comparison with observed uplink in control and test set
\end{itemize}
