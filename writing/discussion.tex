\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

The study of traffic demand has recently gained importance from the policy 
perspective. 

Firstly, the FCC recognizes the need to define broadband benchmarks based on 
traffic demand, and is considering to add it in the 
future~\cite{fcc2015broadband-report}. It has defined a ``typical'' household 
traffic demand to enable concurrent broadband uses, such as video streaming, 
web 
browsing, and VoIP. Currently, the Commission is asking for comments and 
suggestions on how to define such a demand-based benchmark for future 
planning~\cite{fcc2015progress-report, fcc2014progress-report}.

Secondly, recent research shows that diurnal Internet usage patterns are 
correlated with GDP, Internet allocations, as well as electrical consumption of 
a region~\cite{ant-diurnal-web}. This makes the study of usage behavior 
extremely relevant to the governmental bodies responsible for development, such 
as the FCC, when considering policy decisions.

Finally, the FCC is is responsible for increasing broadband deployment 
throughout the US. Recently, it decided to aggressively increase the 
broadband threshold benchmark to 25 Mbps in downlink and 3 Mbps in uplink. 
However, a survey conducted 
by NCTA (for the FCC) showed that the largest deterrent to broadband adoption 
is that users do not \emph{want} broadband (the second largest deterrent is the 
price)~\cite{fcc2015progress-report}.  This sudden increase 
resulted in a strong backlash from various ISPs, who claim that 
there is not enough demand in many parts of the US.

Both the service providers and the policy makers are asking the same
question: do subscribers need a higher bandwidth broadband, \ie, are the 
subscribers demands not being met by their current service tier?

We study this question for high service tiers. Our results show that the 
prime-time ratio does not change when upgrading from a lower tier to a higher 
one. The ISP may interpret this as no (insignificant) change in demand during 
the prime-time, when the network is expected to be most clogged. We
believe that given the opportunity, a service provider considering increase in 
capacity will not invest in offering a service upgrade in such a scenario. The 
ISP perspective is that the highest demanding subscribers will not be utilizing 
the higher capacity during the prime-time, thus the total demand will not 
increase. This question is considered by ISPs when planning capacity upgrades 
in the future, or considering investment in a new technology or region. For 
example, Google Fiber is now expanding to Salt Lake City, from where 
we received our dataset. The analysis of change in user behavior with capacity 
estimates that a low number of users already on the 105 Mbps service tier will 
actually increase their demand beyond the 105 Mbps capacity if they 
migrate to a higher capacity service offered by Google. 

In contrast, although our results show that the change in demand during 
prime-time was insignificant, we observe a significant increase in demand 
during non-prime-time hours. Furthermore, the increase in demand was higher for 
users who contribute the lowest fraction of traffic to the ISP. This may 
convince subscribers and policy makers alike that individually, the demand of a 
household is affected by the increase in access link capacity, especially for 
subscribers who did not have much demands. We believe that this is the 
perspective the FCC takes when considering deployment and adoption of 
broadband services. Essentially, if any change is observed in demand due to an 
upgraded service, the FCC may interpret that as \emph{adoption} of the higher 
available tier.

The complex relationship between service capacity and traffic demand motivates 
a further study, using controlled and natural experiments. As independent 
researchers in the measurement community, we believe it is our responsibility 
to 
provide a much required input to the FCC when it comes to increasing broadband 
adoption and defining a traffic demand based benchmark. We believe that our work 
is
directly useful to the Commission as a step forward in understanding Internet 
usage.
