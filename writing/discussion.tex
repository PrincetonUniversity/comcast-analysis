\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item results that are contradictory
\item results that data suggests that is wrong
\item a better way to measure and offer broadband based on utilization?
\item multiple benchmarks of users segregated by usage
\item fcc measures: availability to deployment to adoption, maybe go the other way
\item survey sad adoption is low coz (1) user don't need bb and (2) its too expensive
\item if we can estimate (1) as false, providers can be encouraged to build and automatically
reduce (2)
\item significant section of 100 Mbps set shows that they do not cap usage per day in 15 min
\item this means low investment for next tier
\item but a set like 25 or 50 might show otherwise [need data]
\item other metrics: latency, etc considered by fcc
\end{itemize}
