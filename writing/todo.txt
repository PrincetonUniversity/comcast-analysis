Apr 13, 2015: RESULTS TODO

Usage Behavior
- Fig 2 aggregates
- make two sub plots for (a) test and (b) control: (mean of day)
(sum of device) bytes, include (perc90 of day) (sum of device) bytes and
(median of day) (sum of device) bytes. Purpose is to show patterns individually,
not compare differences. Patterns to show are (1) no troughs in usage,
(2) prime-time hours shift(subsection~\ref{subsec:primetime}), (3) difference
between 90\%-ile and median (subsection ~\ref{subsec:peakratio})}

- plot for 1000 random chosen devices with full heartbeat to confirm if peak perc/medians
are same in peak and diff in off peak. Plot both usage per subs and avg data rate.

- separate subplots for M-F and S/S/holidays for test and control -- may not need to show all as weekend graphs are not so surprising.

- Also, test set seems to have this small peak and a trough, but control doesn't. Why??. Test and control medians differ during office hours (10:00 AM to 6:00 PM) but are similar in peak hours...

Meeting with Roya 04/04/2015

Sanitizing the FCC


- INTRODUCTION
	- FCC background and importance
	- Why it matters, why people should care about it, how many people care about it (eg: retweets on decisions). Do we understand it? (ask Ed about importance and if he would find my paper interesting)
	- Power of FCC: its decisions change the economies of play, some policy papers
	- Important that their decisions are based on valid measurements and hypothesis.
	- Technical questions and Other types (?)
	- FCC HYPOTHESIS:
		- H1:
		- H2:
		- H3:
		- ...
	- To evaluate some of FCC decisions we chose broadband usage data from comcast in an urban city with high tier usage. 
	- Sections: Data + Sanitization + Specifications, Methodololy, Analysis of observations vs FCC Hypothesis


- Comcast Data

- Methodology
	- Challenges (including sanitization)
	- Means, medians, percentiles
	- Importance of measuring peak
	- Measuring one city and tier: advantage [data characterization above??]
	- Shorcomings of the data
		- 15 mins granularity is low but way better than aggregate sandvine (hourly? monthly?) and FCC statistics
		- user end instead of server end or inside the ISP: controlled environment (although bismark and samknows are the same - what is samknows granularity)


- Results and Analysis
	#- FCC perspective
	- H1:
	- How we approach
	- results/figure
	- comparison with sandvine/FCC
	- Reject/Accept/Don't Know?
	- H2: Latency
	- We can't answer although important
	- H3: Prime Time
	- in next section we discuss a worst time scenario metric we came up with: peak ratio
	- H4: Asymmetry
	- results/fig
	- Cisco alcatel cite + our thoughts
	- H5: Price vs usage
	- approach: histogram of max reached per device
	- show usage didnt increase much apart from 1% outliers
	- no usage change after a certain price limit.
	- also show this doesn't agree with popular DASU util inc as capacity inc hypothesis
	#- is it worth it Google Fiber?
	#- Should ISPs be marketting plans to dumb consumers or give them unlimited BW but cap total Bytes during congestion hrs based on congestion IDK

	#- ISP perspective?
	

- Discussion (suggestions for FCC)
	- peak time
	- user taxonomy
		#- FCC family of 3 defines general limit of 25 Mbps
		#- Sandvine simply heavy hitters, typical, non-streamer
		#- we consider peak ratio + usage to classify in 4 types
			#- use it coz business is a big contributer in urban cities


- Related + Conclusion
	- FCC is important
	- should make policies based on true measurements
	- ISP perspective

	- Policy + Measurement techniques


###############################################################################

RESULT PLOTS
- rationale for 25/3? Does that mean if there were outliers FCC will change definition? More attetion to evidence needed
- 24 hrs avg vs peaktime [CDF max vs avg per day]
- machines reaching threshhold byte rate in their lifetime [histogram]
- asymmetry
- machines total usage tier throughout 3 months [should be part of data characterization not the results]

DATA:


%explain that due to no bias in city, and large number of users, this can be 
%interpreted as change or no change in behavior due to increase in capacity of 
%the link. We expect the baseline behavior of these users to be exactly the 
%same. 
%Thus we will put our questions as "change in behavior due to increase in 
%capacity" rather than analysis of two different datasets as we have attempted 
%to 
%eliminate all biases.


%final datasets for each control, each month, and full
%\sg{after sanitization, we can either compare test to each control in the same 
%time range and draw agg conclusions, or do it by month, or combo it into a 
%huge control set and compare it with test set}
%\sg{Present results for full sets, unless there is a significant difference in 
%any trends or distributions}

% not telling users that the connection was upgraded lets us study correlation 
%between usage and capacity without the bias of user changing his behavior due 
%to external factors (buying a device, being more aggressive as they bought a 
%new plan)
% DASU supports correlation by measuring usage on each ISP tier, even for those 
%who changed tiers, but that is biased by user buying a higher tier when they 
%feel unsatisfied. It does not have a good representation of the case when the 
%ISP offers extra bandwidth without charging. Even if it does, the user knows 
%about the capacity bump inducing a change in behavior. Our dataset is unbiased 
%in that manner, we don't expect users to know they have a higher capacity and 
%still study if there is change in behavior


%Both the \test and \control sets were collected from users in Salt Lake City, 
%Utah, to avoid any biases in behavior based on location. Although this dataset 
%corresponds to just one ISP, we believe that it is broadly representative of 
%urban users in the US in the same, or higher broadband bandwidth tier ($\>$ 
%100 Mbps). Thus, we use this data to draw general conclusions about behavioral 
%change with link capacity \todo{(add more here...) }

%\subsection{Data Processing}

% split database by direction, combine service class name
%To process the large amount of data (more than 15000 unique devices, 96 time 
%slots per day, 3 months, multiple service classes per time-slot), we first 
%split the data by direction into uplink and downlink. The nature of the 
%questions we ask in section~\ref{sec:intro} encourages us to concentrate on 
%the downstream data, although we present similar results for upstream data in 
%section~\ref{sec:results}. We also do not use the service class name 
%identifier in our analysis, which is internal to Comcast. \todo{Our analysis 
%showed that ignoring the service class identifier does not change our 
%conclusions on usage patterns and statistics.} Thus we only considered overall 
%usage for each gateway device in each time slot, in uplink and downlink 
%direction.



% remove weird dates with very low machines
%On exploring \control 4, we noticed that the dataset spanned the 
%October-December period, but for the first week there were 15000 unique 
%devices reporting their usage statistics, while after the first week, the 
%number dropped to 5000. Furthermore, \control 5 and \control 6 reported usage 
%for 5000 devices in the month of November, but only a 100 devices in December. 
%We did not want stray devices impacting our measure of availability, therefore 
%we sliced the \control datasets to monthly date ranges with a minimum of 4000, 
%or at least half the total unique devices present.
% why 4000? --- eyeballing availability plots -- 3k to 4k seemed to be the right 
%choice for control4
