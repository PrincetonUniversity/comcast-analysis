Meeting with Roya 04/04/2015

Sanitizing the FCC


- INTRODUCTION
	- FCC background and importance
	- Why it matters, why people should care about it, how many people care about it (eg: retweets on decisions). Do we understand it? (ask Ed about importance and if he would find my paper interesting)
	- Power of FCC: its decisions change the economies of play, some policy papers
	- Important that their decisions are based on valid measurements and hypothesis.
	- Technical questions and Other types (?)
	- FCC HYPOTHESIS:
		- H1:
		- H2:
		- H3:
		- ...
	- To evaluate some of FCC decisions we chose broadband usage data from comcast in an urban city with high tier usage. 
	- Sections: Data + Sanitization + Specifications, Methodololy, Analysis of observations vs FCC Hypothesis


- Comcast Data

- Methodology
	- Challenges (including sanitization)
	- Means, medians, percentiles
	- Importance of measuring peak
	- Measuring one city and tier: advantage [data characterization above??]
	- Shorcomings of the data
		- 15 mins granularity is low but way better than aggregate sandvine (hourly? monthly?) and FCC statistics
		- user end instead of server end or inside the ISP: controlled environment (although bismark and samknows are the same - what is samknows granularity)


- Results and Analysis
	#- FCC perspective
	- H1:
	- How we approach
	- results/figure
	- comparison with sandvine/FCC
	- Reject/Accept/Don't Know?
	- H2: Latency
	- We can't answer although important
	- H3: Prime Time
	- in next section we discuss a worst time scenario metric we came up with: peak ratio
	- H4: Asymmetry
	- results/fig
	- Cisco alcatel cite + our thoughts
	- H5: Price vs usage
	- approach: histogram of max reached per device
	- show usage didnt increase much apart from 1% outliers
	- no usage change after a certain price limit.
	- also show this doesn't agree with popular DASU util inc as capacity inc hypothesis
	#- is it worth it Google Fiber?
	#- Should ISPs be marketting plans to dumb consumers or give them unlimited BW but cap total Bytes during congestion hrs based on congestion IDK

	#- ISP perspective?
	

- Discussion (suggestions for FCC)
	- peak time
	- user taxonomy
		#- FCC family of 3 defines general limit of 25 Mbps
		#- Sandvine simply heavy hitters, typical, non-streamer
		#- we consider peak ratio + usage to classify in 4 types
			#- use it coz business is a big contributer in urban cities


- Related + Conclusion
	- FCC is important
	- should make policies based on true measurements
	- ISP perspective

	- Policy + Measurement techniques

RESULT PLOTS
- rationale for 25/3? Does that mean if there were outliers FCC will change definition? More attetion to evidence needed
- 24 hrs avg vs peaktime [CDF max vs avg per day]
- machines reaching threshhold byte rate in their lifetime [histogram]
- asymmetry
- machines total usage tier throughout 3 months [should be part of data characterization not the results]
