\sg{Outliers. Prevalence.}
While the general behavior did not change, 11 users maxed out traffic.
For example (explain the fig: any user reaching the threshold at ANY time 
over three months). Only 2 users in the \control{} group reached high 
utilization at \textbf{any} moment. In \treatment{} 11 such users were present, 
for whom utilization over their lifetime was greater than 1 when compared to 
the 105 Mbps capacity (but lower than 250 Mbps).
