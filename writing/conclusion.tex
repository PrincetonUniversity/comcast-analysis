\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we study how subscribers respond to an increase in their
ISP's service tier. To do so, we use a randomized control trial that compares
per-subscriber traffic volumes between two groups of Comcast subscribers
in the same city: a control group, with Comcast's 105~Mbps service
offering; and a second group of subscribers who were upgraded to the
250~Mbps service tier without their knowledge.  We observed that
subscribers with more moderate traffic demands increased their traffic
demand relative more than subscribers who were already sending
relatively high traffic volumes.  

Initially, we were surprised by this result: after all, both intuition
and previous work suggest that when users experience service-tier
upgrades, they immediately exhaust the available capacity (particularly
the high-volume subscribers). At higher tiers, however, we observe a
completely different phenomenon: in general, users are not exhausting
the available capacity, but a service tier upgrade may simply result in
a better user experience that causes subscribers with more moderate
traffic demands to use the Internet more than they otherwise would.  The
fact that the most significant increases that we observed as a result of
the service-tier upgrade occurred during non-prime-time hours on
weekdays also suggests that these higher service tiers may generally be
disproportionately used by subscribers who work from home.  Future
research should aim to repeat our experiment for different cohorts (\ie,
different subscribers, geographies, service tiers, and ISPs), and could
also strive to obtain more fine-grained traffic statistics to explore
exactly which applications are responsible for the behavioral changes
that we have observed.

\paragraph{POLICY IMPLICATIONS?}

Demand increases for lower bandwidth users consistently
Relatively more data is sent in off peak hours 

A service provider considering increase in 
capacity will not invest in offering a service upgrade in such a scenario. The 
ISP perspective is that the highest demanding subscribers will not be utilizing 
the higher capacity during the prime-time, thus the total demand will not 
increase. This question is considered by ISPs when planning capacity upgrades 
in the future, or considering investment in a new technology or region. For 
example, Google Fiber is now expanding to Salt Lake City, from where 
we received our dataset. The analysis of change in user behavior with capacity 
estimates that a low number of users already on the 105 Mbps service tier will 
actually increase their demand beyond the 105 Mbps capacity if they 
migrate to a higher capacity service offered by Google. 

This may 
convince subscribers and policy makers alike that individually, the demand of a 
household is affected by the increase in access link capacity, especially for 
subscribers who did not have much demands. We believe that this is the 
perspective the FCC takes when considering deployment and adoption of 
broadband services. Essentially, if any change is observed in demand due to an 
upgraded service, the FCC may interpret that as \emph{adoption} of the higher 
available tier.
