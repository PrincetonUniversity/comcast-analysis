\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\todo{This is the results section}

We present a comparison between the usage characteristics of the control\footnote{gateway byte counters from users with a 105 Mbps access link} and test\footnote{gateway byte counters from users with a 105 Mbps access link}. We interpret the results as change in usage behavior due to increase in access link bandwidth. %although these are two separate sets of devices we interpret them as changes as explained in "methodology" or "data"

\subsection{User Behavior}
\label{subsec:behavior}

\hypoth{1}. Does aggregate user behavior differ?

\subsection{Peak Utilization}
\label{subsec:peak-util}

\hypoth{2}. Does the maximum (or 90-\%ile) data transferred by the device differ?

\subsection{Prime Time Ratio}
\label{subsec:prime-time}

\hypoth{3}. Does the prime-time ratio differ?

\subsection{Peak Ratio}
\label{subsec:peak-ratio}

\hypoth{4}. How much does the traffic vary in a single day?


\subsection{Traffic Asymmetry}
\label{subsec:asymmetry}
\todo{maybe this doesn't need a separate section, just comment on asymmetry in each of the above - plot uplink also}
