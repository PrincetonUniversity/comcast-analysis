\subsection{Analysis}
\label{subsec:results}

We evaluate the usage behavior of the \test$_{full}$\footnote{household byte counters
from (unknown) users with a 250 Mbps access link}  and the \control$_{full}$\footnote{household
byte counters from users with a 105 Mbps access link} sets based
on the criteria in table~\ref{tab:eval-criteria}. We interpret the behavior of the datasets
both separately as well as comparatively: (1) general inferences drawn from analyzing the dataset,
and (2) comparative inferences drawn from observing changes in user behavior due to the upgrade
in access link bandwidth (as explained in section~\ref{subsec:data-relevance})
%although these are two separate sets of devices we interpret them as changes as explained in "relevance of the data"

First, we examine usage behavior and prime-time ratio as aggregates seen at the ISP. We use 
the total data usage per subscriber parameter to study these quantities. Next, we
evaluate the utilization and peak time for each household in our dataset. We present the ISP
perspective of utilization, and compare it to a users' perspective (FCC by proxy). We discuss
a taxonomy of users based on their usage behavior and requirements. %thereby urging the FCC to
% consider multiple standards based on usage for future benchmarks.
