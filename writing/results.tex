\section{Results}

\todo{This is the results section}

We present a comparison between the usage characteristics of the control\footnote{household byte counters from users with a 105 Mbps access link} and test\footnote{household byte counters from users with a 105 Mbps access link}. We interpret the any variation between the results of both sets as a change in usage behavior due to increase in access link bandwidth.
%although these are two separate sets of devices we interpret them as changes as explained in "methodology" or "data"
