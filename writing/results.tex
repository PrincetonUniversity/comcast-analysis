\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We evaluate the usage behavior of the $\test_{full}$\footnote{household byte counters
from (unknown) users with a 250 Mbps access link}  and the $\control_{full}$\footnote{household
byte counters from users with a 105 Mbps access link} sets based
on the criteria in table~\ref{tab:eval-criteria}. We interpret the behavior of the datasets
both separately as well as comparatively: (1) general inferences drawn from analyzing the dataset,
and (2) comparative inferences drawn from observing changes in user behavior due to the upgrade
in access link bandwidth (as explained in section~\ref{subsec:data-relevance})
%although these are two separate sets of devices we interpret them as changes as explained in "relevance of the data"
