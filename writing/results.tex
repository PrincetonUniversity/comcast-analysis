\todo{This is the results section}

We present a comparison between the usage characteristics of the control\footnote{gateway byte counters from users with a 105 Mbps access link} and test\footnote{gateway byte counters from users with a 105 Mbps access link}. We interpret the results as change in usage behavior due to increase in access link bandwidth. %although these are two separate sets of devices we interpret them as changes as explained in "methodology" or "data"

\subsection{User Behavior}
\label{subsec:behavior}

\hypoth{}. Does aggregate user behavior change on increasing the access link capacity?

\subsection{Peak Utilization}
\label{subsec:peak-util}

\hypoth{}. Does the maximum (or 90-\%ile) data rate change due to the increase in capacity?

\subsection{Prime Time Ratio}
\label{subsec:prime-time}

\hypoth{}. Do usage characteristics change on increasing the access link capacity from 105 Mbps to 250 Mbps?

\subsection{Traffic Asymmetry}
\label{subsec:asymmetry}



\subsection{User Taxonomy}
