\section{Empirical Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

%The nature of the randomized controlled experiment used to collect the dataset 
%of high service tier users allows us to evaluate the effect of a 
%\emph{factor}, the service plan upgrade, as a treatment applied to a control 
%group. 

Controlled experiments are difficult to do on the Internet scale. However, in 
our work, we had access to a dataset collected through a randomized control 
experiment on the scale of a large city. This enables us to study the effect of 
just one factor, \emph{the service plan upgrade}, while other
factors, such as price, performance, or regional differences between users, are
controlled.

Our dataset mitigates several biases that previous studies may have 
suffered. Studying the behavior of users who buy a higher service plan
(unsatisfied subscribers) will naturally show an increase in demand on
upgrading service. Similarly users who have been offered a free upgrade
may unknowingly change their behavior to utilize the upgraded tier
(cognitive bias). Studying datasets with these biases are prone 
to positive correlations between usage and capacity. We avoid this by examining 
a single high capacity tier (satisfied users) with an unannounced upgrade.

\paragraph{Evaluation Criteria. } The aim of our work is to study changes in
traffic demand in response to service tier upgrades. To define this change, we 
use the evaluation criteria in table~\ref{tab:eval-criteria}. The \emph{traffic 
demand} for a subscriber is defined as the total bytes transferred, in 
upstream or downstream, during a single measurement period (15 minutes).
We use traffic demand to calculate the total demand per hour, the average demand 
in a day, and the 95th percentile peak demand over a day. To compare the total
traffic of the control and treatment groups, we scale it to a thousand subscribers where
applicable (table~\ref{tab:data-stats}).

Diurnal Internet usage is known to be the highest during the prime-time evening 
hours. For our analysis, we define \emph{prime time} as 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM.
We consistently observed a daily demand within 90 percentile of the 
total demand per day during this four hour period. The \emph{prime-time ratio} is 
defined as the ratio between the average demand during a prime-time hour, 
to the average demand outside the prime-time hour. This ratio conveys the
disparity between demand during the prime-time and the rest of the day.

Our analysis shows that subscribers that were not utilizing the link 
heavily in the control set increase their usage multiple times. However,
we also show that although the overall demand increases due to the 
service upgrade, the increase during prime-time hours was insignificant. 
To study the increase outside prime time hours, we use \emph{peak-ratio},
defined as the the daily 95 percentile to mean ratio of traffic demand.
