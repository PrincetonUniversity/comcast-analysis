The aim of our work is to study changes in
traffic demand in response to service tier upgrades. We evaluate this
change using the criteria in table~\ref{tab:eval-criteria}. The \emph{traffic 
demand} for a subscriber is defined as the total bytes transferred, in 
upstream or downstream, during a single measurement period (15 minutes).
We use traffic demand to calculate the total demand per hour, the average demand 
in a day, and the 95th percentile peak demand over a day. To compare the total
traffic of the control and treatment groups, we scale to a thousand subscribers
wherever applicable (table~\ref{tab:data-stats}).

Diurnal Internet usage is known to be the highest during the prime-time evening 
hours. For our analysis, we define \emph{prime time} as 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM.
We consistently observed a that the daily demand falls within 90th percentile
during this four hour period. The \emph{prime-time ratio} is defined as the
ratio between the average hourly traffic during a
prime-time hour, to the average hourly traffic outside the prime-time hour.
This ratio conveys the disparity between demand during the prime-time and
the rest of the day.

Our analysis shows that although the overall demand increases due to the 
service upgrade, the increase during prime-time hours was insignificant. 
To study the changes in overall daily demand, we use \emph{peak-ratio},
defined as the the daily 95 percentile to mean ratio of traffic demand.
