\section{Empirical Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

%The nature of the randomized controlled experiment used to collect the dataset 
%of high service tier users allows us to evaluate the effect of a 
%\emph{factor}, the service plan upgrade, as a treatment applied to a control 
%group. 

Controlled experiments are difficult to do on the Internet scale. However, in 
our work, we had access to a randomized control experiment used to collect a 
dataset on the scale of a large city. This enables us to study the effect of 
just one factor, \emph{the service plan upgrade}, while controlling the affect 
of other factors, such as price, performance, or regional differences between 
users.

We mitigate the effect of several biases that previous studies may have 
suffered. Studying users who buy a higher service plan (unsatisfied users) will 
naturally show an increase in demand on upgrading service. Similarly users who 
know they have an available upgrade may change their behavior to utilize the 
upgraded tier (cognitive bias). Studying datasets with these biases are prone 
to positive correlations between usage and capacity. We avoid this by examining 
a single high capacity tier (satisfied users) with an unannounced upgrade.

\paragraph{Evaluation Criteria. } We aim to answer the question: does the 
traffic
demand change in response to service tier upgrades? To define this change, we 
use 
the evaluation criteria in table~\ref{tab:eval-criteria}. The \emph{traffic 
demand} for a subscriber is defined as the total bytes transferred, in 
uplink or downlink direction, during a single measurement period (15 minutes).
We use traffic demand to calculate the total demand per hour, the average demand 
in a day,
and the 95th percentile peak demand. To compare the total traffic of the
control and treatment groups, we scale it to a thousand subscribers where
applicable (table~\ref{tab:data-stats}).

Diurnal Internet usage is known to be the highest during the prime-time evening 
hours.
For our analysis, we define \emph{prime time} as 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM. We 
observed the highest
daily demand during this four hour period. The \emph{prime-time ratio} is 
defined as the ratio between 
the average demand during a prime-time hour, to the average demand outside the 
prime-time hour. This lets us study the disparity between demand during the
prime-time and the rest of the day.

Our analysis showed that although the overall demand increases due to the 
service upgrade, 
the increase during prime-time hours was insignificant. To study the increase 
outside
prime time hours, we define the \emph{peak-ratio} as the the daily 95 percentile 
to mean ratio
of traffic demand.
