\section{Empirical Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

Controlled experiments are difficult to do on the Internet scale. In
our work, we had access to a dataset collected through a randomized control 
experiment on the scale of a large urban city. This enables us to study the effect of 
just one factor, \emph{the service plan upgrade}, while other
factors, such as price, performance, or regional differences between users, are
controlled. We believe the affects observed on this dataset will also
be observed in others collected from urban cities and high tiers.

By examining a single ISP's high capacity tier with an unannounced upgrade,
our dataset mitigates several biases that previous studies may have 
suffered. Studying the behavior of users who opt for buying a higher service plan
(unsatisfied subscribers) will naturally show an increase in demand on
upgrading service. Similarly users who have been offered a free upgrade in service
may unknowingly change their behavior to utilize the upgraded capacity
(cognitive bias). Studying datasets with these biases are prone 
to showing a positive high correlation between demand and capacity.

\paragraph{Evaluation Criteria. } The aim of our work is to study changes in
traffic demand in response to service tier upgrades. We evaluate this
change using the criteria in table~\ref{tab:eval-criteria}. The \emph{traffic 
demand} for a subscriber is defined as the total bytes transferred, in 
upstream or downstream, during a single measurement period (15 minutes).
We use traffic demand to calculate the total demand per hour, the average demand 
in a day, and the 95th percentile peak demand over a day. To compare the total
traffic of the control and treatment groups, we scale to a thousand subscribers
wherever applicable (table~\ref{tab:data-stats}).

Diurnal Internet usage is known to be the highest during the prime-time evening 
hours. For our analysis, we define \emph{prime time} as 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM.
We consistently observed a that the daily demand falls within 90th percentile
during this four hour period. The \emph{prime-time ratio} is defined as the
ratio between the average hourly traffic during a
prime-time hour, to the average hourly traffic outside the prime-time hour.
This ratio conveys the disparity between demand during the prime-time and
the rest of the day.

Our analysis shows that although the overall demand increases due to the 
service upgrade, the increase during prime-time hours was insignificant. 
To study the changes in overall daily demand, we use \emph{peak-ratio},
defined as the the daily 95 percentile to mean ratio of traffic demand.
