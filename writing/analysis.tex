\paragraph{Metrics}
Table~\ref{tab:eval-criteria} shows the metrics that we use to evaluate
how user demand responds to service-tier upgrades. The \emph{traffic
  demand} for a subscriber is defined as the total bytes transferred, in
upstream or downstream, during a single sample measurement (15 minutes).
We use traffic demand to calculate the total demand per hour, and the
average and 95th percentile peak demand over a day. To compare the total
traffic of the control and treatment groups, we scale to a thousand
subscribers wherever applicable (Table~\ref{tab:data-stats}).  We
define \emph{prime time} as 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m., when Internet usage
tends to be highest.  Indeed, we
observed that the total daily traffic consistently falls within 90th percentile
during this four-hour period. We define the \emph{prime-time ratio} as
the ratio of traffic during an average prime-time hour, to the average
hourly traffic outside the prime-time hour.  This ratio conveys the
disparity between demand during the prime-time and the rest of the day.
The rest of this section explores the effects of a service-tier upgrade
on user traffic demand in the context of these metrics.
