\section{Empirical Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

%The nature of the randomized controlled experiment used to collect the dataset 
%of high service tier users allows us to evaluate the effect of a 
%\emph{factor}, the service plan upgrade, as a treatment applied to a control 
%group. 

Controlled experiments are difficult to do on the Internet scale. However, in 
our work, we had access to a randomized control experiment used to collect a 
dataset on the scale of a large city. This enables us to study the effect of 
just one factor, \emph{the service plan upgrade}, while controlling the affect 
of other factors, such as price, performance, or regional differences between 
users.

By studying a particular group of high service plan users, who were 
upgraded without their knowledge, we mitigate the affect of biases that 
previous studies on usage and capacity suffer from: (a) \emph{Avoid behavioral 
change bias:} offering users with high capacity a further increase without 
their knowledge avoids the risk of behavioral changes that may occur when one 
purposefully buys a higher bandwidth connection; and (b) \emph{Avoid 
dissatisfied user bias:} we study high capacity tier users in a \control{} 
group, that are are not utilizing their access link completely, and thereby 
mitigate the effect of traffic biases that occur because subscribers' previous 
capacity was insufficient for their usage. Studying datasets with these biases 
are prone to positive correlations between usage and capacity, which we 
avoid by examining a single high capacity tier with an unannounced upgrade.

\paragraph{Evaluation Criteria. } We aim to answer the question: is there a 
change in traffic demand with service tier upgrades? To define change, we use 
the evaluation criteria defined in table~\ref{tab:eval-criteria}. The traffic 
demand for a subscriber is defined as the total bytes transferred, in 
uplink or downlink, during a single measurement period (15 minutes).

Diurnal Internet usage is known to be the highest during the evening hours from 
7:00 PM to 11:00 PM \cite{fcc2015broadband-report}. The consumption of high 
bandwidth video is at its daily maximum during prime-time. Our observations 
showed that the consumption was highest for the control and treatment groups 
between 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM. To study the disparity is demand during prime-time 
and the rest of the day, we define the prime-time ratio as the ratio between 
the average demand during a prime-time hour, to the average demand outside the 
prime-time hour.

Our analysis showed that although demand increases due to the service upgrade, 
the increase during prime-time hours was insignificant. We study the daily 95 
percentile to mean ratio for subscribers to evaluate whether disparity between 
the peak (95 percentile demand) and the mean increases at times other than 
prime-time.
