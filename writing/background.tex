\section{Background and Motivation}
%Context: FCC
\label{sec:background}

With FCC's recent release of the Open Internet Order~\ref{}, and broadband limit reclassification 

\sg{Previous work states as capacity increases, usage increases, but we feel usage is a function of 3 entities: user, ISP, service provider, and with bb reclassification, the ISP is taking itself out of the loop?}

\sg{aim is to compare usage in high and low tier. So do an experiment with Comcast 105 to 250 without telling users}

\subsection{FCC}
