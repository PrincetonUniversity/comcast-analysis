\subsection{Peak Usage}\label{subsec:peakratio}


Internet usage throughout a day follows diurnal sleep-patterns, and researchers
have shown that such patterns are in fact correlated with GDP, Internet allocations,
as well as electrical consumption of a region~\cite{ant-diurnal-web}. This makes
the study of usage behavior extremely relevant to the governmental bodies responsible
for development, such as the FCC, when considering policy decisions. 


\paragraph{Peak Ratio: }The Sandvine Reports show that although the mean usage has remained
stable for the past few years, usage during peak-times has increased
drastically~\cite{sandvine20141h}. To measure this growth, they introduce the
concept of peak period, measured when the network is within 95\% of its highest point.
Although, these reports present a good view into aggregate usage patterns over a month,
they neglect to analyze usage characteristics individually. Inspired by their
definition, we measure the disparity between the 90 percentile of the peak and median
usage of each household within a day, and call this the \emph{Peak-Ratio}. In
section~\ref{subsec:peakratio} we show that the peak ratio can be used
to divide users in the same tier based on their usage behavior.

% the ratio of the 90\%-ile to the median throughput per day.

To further characterize and compare the deviation of data rate for the \control and \test set, we examine \emph{peak-ratio} as defined above. 
Figure ~\ref{fig:CDF-peak-ratio-median} shows that the median peak-ratio for each device in the \test set is much larger than that of the \control set.
\todo{replace much larger with the exact number or percentage}.
\sg{Taken together} with our observations of a lower prime-time ratio of the \test set (section~\ref{subsec:primetime}) this implies that there are households in the \test set that achieve a peak-ratio $>$ 1, but not during the prime-time hour. We believe that these households might actually be small businesses or work-at-home users that peak during daytime hours instead of evening hours.

The median peak-ratio per device itself shows a large range, from 1 to 10e6 (figure~\ref{fig:CDF-peak-ratio-median}), and the maximum peak-ratio per device was an order higher. Clearly there are some households that have a very even usage throughout the day (low peak ratio), and others that are extremely aggressive only at certain times (high peak ratio). We plot this segregation in figure ~\ref{fig:CDF-prime-time-ratio}.


% other results:
%big difference (2 x median ratio) in per device per day ratios of 90%ile:median.
%weird shape again for values < ratio 100
%big difference in this ratio per day, and it is consistent across all individual sets + months.
%very large for Dec, slightly smaller for Nov
%interestingly, at higher ratios control is slightly > test. This means that certain devices in control set have a huge std (ratio) in a day as compared to test set which has a lower “max” ratio.

Based on differing usage profiles within the same high tier bandwidth, we suggest that the FCC adopt multiple benchmarks based on usage characteristics to better characterize broadband availability, deployment, and adoption in the US. Such multiple benchmarks can be the minimum broadband speed required per user based on the kind of traffic expected during a day. ISPs can also offer these users better plans based on hour-of-the-day or usage caps to encourage more off-peak usage. These users probably don't cause latency spikes in PT.
