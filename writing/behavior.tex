\subsection{Traffic Demand Per Subscriber}\label{subsec:behavior}

Internet usage throughout a day follows diurnal sleep-patterns, and researchers
have shown that such patterns are in fact correlated with GDP, Internet 
allocations, as well as electrical consumption of 
a region~\cite{ant-diurnal-web}. This makes the study of usage behavior 
extremely relevant to the governmental bodies responsible
for development, such as the FCC, when considering policy decisions.

We start by evaluating traffic demand. We calculate demand by averaging the 
bytes transferred in uplink or downlink direction over the sample period (15 
minutes). This allows us to capture both the average per subscriber demand at 
any time in a day, and the aggregate demand at the ISP over a longer period, 
such as a day or a week.

To characterize diurnal user behavior as observed at the ISP, we first calculate
usage per subscriber (table \ref{tab:eval-criteria}), and then plot the median 
and 95\%-ile of total usage over a week for both \treatment{} and \control{}
sets (figure \ref{fig:TS-data-rate-daily}).

A comparison of the aggregate traffic demand distribution of all devices and sample periods shows
that the \treatment{} has no significant affect on the mean traffic demand. Figure \ref{fig:CDF-data-rate-all}
shows that the median utilization of subscribers throughout the dataset is 50 kbps\sgfoot{confirm}.

Figure \ref{fig:TS-data-rate-daily} shows the aggregate data rate for a day. We observe that the rise to the peak prime time hour usage on weekdays is not plateaued like the pattern observed on weekends (and holidays).
A generic (median) weekday aggregate usage consists of a rise in usage that starts
early in the morning that builds up to the prime-time period, peaks, and then falls sharply.
We do not observe a trough in mid afternoon (between 2:00 PM -- 6:00 PM), as is usually
the case for overall usage observed at US Fixed access providers \cite{sandvine20141h}.

We observed that the median traffic demand during 7:00 PM -- 7:00 AM is \todo{XXX} for
both \treatment{} and \control{}. However, during off peak daytime (work) hours, between
7:00 AM -- 7:00 PM, the \treatment{} group has a median of \todo{XXX}, 20\% higher than
the \control{} set.
